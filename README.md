# Arlo Wordpress Framework

1. Change ```.env-example``` to ```.env```
2. Add your database details and paths
3. run ```composer install```

Alternatively just use composer

```composer create-project asha23/arlo-framework-laravel-mix```

### Notes

This is a very barebones setup. It does include a base theme, but doesn't rely on it.
