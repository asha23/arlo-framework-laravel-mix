# Arlo Wordpress Framework

1. Add your database details and paths in the .env file
2. run ```composer install```

Alternatively just use composer to install in your folder of choice

```composer create-project asha23/arlo-framework-laravel-mix```

### Notes

This is a very barebones setup. It does include a base theme, but doesn't rely on it.
